## Instructions to Use the Link to Start the Service and Access the EC2 Instance
1. Start the EC2 Instance:
- Open your web browser and navigate to the following URL: [Start EC2 Instance](https://h2kueaswak.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/start-jokes-app).
- This will trigger the Lambda function to start the EC2 instance.

2. Retrieve the Public IP Address:
- The response from the above URL will contain a JSON object.
- Look for the key body in the JSON response. It will contain a message similar to: EC2 instance started and will stop after 10 minutes. Public IP: <your_public_ip>.
- Note the <your_public_ip> provided in the response.

3. Visit the Website:
- Open a new tab in your web browser.
- Enter the public IP address noted in the previous step in the address bar.
- Press Enter to visit the website hosted on your EC2 instance.
- Must use http NOT https

Example Response and Usage
- Example JSON Response:
   ```json
      {
          "statusCode": 200,
          "body": "EC2 instance started and will stop after 10 minutes. Public IP: 54.123.45.67"
      }
   ```
- Example Public IP Address:
   - In this example, the public IP is 54.123.45.67.
   - To visit the website, you would enter http://54.123.45.67 in your web browserâ€™s address bar.
- Errors:
   - You may see an error that says: "The instance 'i-09798536a5d851b41' is not in a state from which it can be started."
      - If this is the case, simply wait 30 seconds and try again, this is caused by trying to start the instance while in a "shutting down" state
   - You may otherwise see and error that says: "Public IP: No public IP assigned yet, please wait 10 seconds and refresh this page (can take up to a minute to load IP)"
      - Simply follow the instructions and wait adn continue to refresh the page until the IP is served.

Follow these steps each time you need to start the EC2 instance and access your website. The instance will automatically stop after 10 minutes.
